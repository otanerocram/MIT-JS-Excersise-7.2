# PacMan Assignment

# Description: 
> Short project description. 

In this project, it is possible to make appear one or many pacman on the screen and make them move around and bounce off the webpage limits.

It is recommended to view the map in full screen size for better experience. However, the project works even if the window is not at full screen.

# Installation: 
> There is nothing to install in here.

If you want to test this project you will have to download the .html, .js, and .css files to your computer. 

# Usage: 
> This project has a very simple user interface.

Once you have downloaded all the files to your computer you then only require to open the .html file and click on the button that says Add PacMan to add a new instance of a pacman, repeat until you are satisfied with the amount of pacmen on screen, then click on the Start Game button to make the PacMen move around.

You could also add more PacMan after starting the game, simply repeat the process described previously to add new pacman instances.

Trick: If you would like to see all of the pacmen on screen to speed up, click again on the Start Game button. The PacMen will start to move even faster each time you press the Start Game button.
