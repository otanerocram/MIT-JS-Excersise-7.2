## Description: 
Implementation of multiple Pacmans within the DOM by means of the `makePac` function triggered by the `Add Pacmen` button and then bounced within the DOM window by pressing the `Start Game` button

### See in Action
[Live Demo!](https://otanerocram.github.io/MIT-JS-Excersise-7.2/index.html)

## Installation: 
Just download code and copy to your public_html Apache web server. No installation is required.

## Usage: 
Once you have index.html opened in your browser
- Click the "Add PacMan" button, a new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen. 
- Click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen. 
- When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.

## Roadmap: 
> In the next realease:
> - It would play sounds when bounces at the edge. 
> - Make multi color pacmen when function `makePac` fires
